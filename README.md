Conduit is an event-driven platform for orchestrating software delivery lifecycle (SDLC) workflows. It addresses the challenges of siloed tooling by providing a central coordination layer that connects and automates your existing CI/CD systems.

## The Problem

Modern SDLCs rely on a diverse set of specialized tools, each handling a specific part of the delivery process. These tools often operate in isolation, leading to:

*   **Lack of Visibility:** No single view of the entire workflow.
*   **Manual Coordination:** Human operators acting as the "glue" between systems.
*   **Inconsistent Governance:** Difficulty enforcing policies across different tools.
*   **Limited Optimization:** Inability to measure and improve end-to-end performance.

## The Solution: Event-Driven Orchestration with Conduit

Conduit solves these problems by:

1.  **Embracing CDEvents:** Conduit leverages [CDEvents](https://cdevents.dev/), a standardized vocabulary for CI/CD events, to normalize data from different tools.
2.  **Defining Workflow Segments:** Conduit introduces the concept of Workflow Segments, which define standardized contracts for common SDLC activities (e.g., Build, Test, Deploy).
3.  **Providing a Central Orchestration Engine:** Conduit acts as a central nervous system, observing events, understanding them in the context of Workflow Segments, and coordinating actions based on your defined policies.

## Key Concepts

*   **Events:** Notifications emitted by tools in your SDLC (e.g., "build started," "test finished," "deployment successful").
*   **Workflow Segments:** Standardized representations of SDLC activities, with defined inputs, outputs, events, and states.
*   **Policies:** Rules that define how Conduit should respond to specific events or conditions.
*   **Actions:** Automated tasks triggered by Conduit based on policies (e.g., "pause deployment," "create Jira ticket," "trigger rollback").

## How Conduit Works

1.  **Event Listeners:** Conduit captures events from your existing tools through dedicated listeners.
2.  **Segment Mapper:** Events are mapped to corresponding Workflow Segments, providing context and meaning.
3.  **Policy Engine:** Conduit evaluates policies based on the incoming events and segment data.
4.  **Action Trigger:** When a policy is triggered, Conduit executes the defined actions.

## Benefits of Using Conduit

*   **Preserves Existing Tool Investments:** Works with your current CI/CD systems.
*   **Breaks Down Silos:** Connects teams and tools for better collaboration.
*   **Enables End-to-End Governance:** Enforces consistent policies across the SDLC.
*   **Provides Holistic Observability:** Offers end-to-end visibility for continuous improvement.
*   **Automates Complex Workflows:** Simplifies and automates complex SDLC processes.
